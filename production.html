        <p>
            Music production is the process by which music is created, captured, manipulated, and preserved so that it
            can be distributed and enjoyed. All of the recorded music that you know and love exists because it went 
            through the production process, no matter how well-known or underground a recording may be, and 
            no matter how minimalist or maximalist it sounds.
            Professional music production is creative and technical. It requires well-developed listening skills,
            a good handle on recording technology, a deep musical knowledge, and effective project management and
            leadership skills by a music producer, also known as a record producer.
